# Notes for building donmc.github.io

Continuing with the idea of supporting *binder.blog:* **folder**.
This idea surfaced in yesterday's [post]({% post_url 2025-10-22-notebook %}).

Now a generic *binder* front matter will look something like this:

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}
---
layout: default
title: Today's conclusion: It's about Russia
date:   2025-10-23 01:00:00 -0700
binder:
  tome:  WarAndPeace  # a single word common to all levels
  level: blog # book | chapter | blog | page : presentation level of this file.
  topics: [ characters ]
  themes: [ romance ] # applies to chapter level
  blog: wap/StudyGroup # notebook | folder | ... : tome may have multiple blogs 

---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

A file's membership in the **WarAndPeace** **StudyGroup** blog
would be determined by *binder.tome: WarAndPeace*, *binder.level: blog* and
*binder.blog: StudyGroup*.

Note the usual date-based file name convention is also expected for blog files
(but not required).

Another note is that the *binder.blog:* **argument** can be used to 
separate different blogs under the same tome.  This is the suggested approach.

Here is a development version of the *measurement-afr_blog.md* file followed
by it's rendering:

{% highlight markdown %}

layout: default
title: Notebook
date:   2025-10-22 01:00:00 -0700
binder:
  tome:  measurement  # a single word common to all levels in the work 
  level: chapter # identifies presentation level of this file.
  topics: [ ] # applies to book level
  themes: [ AFR ] # applies to chapter level

Hardlinks demonstrating deep directories:

[Hardlink to a collection file]( {{ site.url | append: "/mini/history_.html" }} )

[Hardlink to a file in the root blog directory]( {{ site.url | append: "/mini/blog/blog_.html" }} )

[Hardlink to a file in the afr blog directory]( {{ site.url | append: "/mini/blog/afr/afr_.html" }} )

The *measurement/afr* blog:
<div>
  <ol>
  {% include binder_tome_blog_list.html collection=site.mini tome="measurement" blog="measurement/afr" %}
  </ol>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Rendering of above:

Hardlinks demonstrating deep directories:

[Hardlink to a collection file]( {{ site.url | append: "/mini/history_.html" }} )

[Hardlink to a file in the root blog directory]( {{ site.url | append: "/mini/blog/blog_.html" }} )

[Hardlink to a file in the afr blog directory]( {{ site.url | append: "/mini/blog/afr/afr_.html" }} )

The *measurement/afr* blog:

(This next include is commented out because it does weird stuff to _posts 
"all posts on one page" )

(...but it works as intended in this page :-) )

{% comment %}
<div>
  <ol>
  {% include binder_tome_blog_list.html collection=site.mini tome="measurement" blog="measurement/afr" %}
  </ol>
</div>
{% endcomment %}

At this time I will commit and post to see that this works at github.io
