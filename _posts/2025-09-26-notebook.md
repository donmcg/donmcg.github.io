# Notes for building donmc.github.io


|[Published GitHub Site](https://donmcg.github.io) | [local site](http://localhost:4000) |

{% highlight bash %}

  # on github created personal access token

  m2 $ cd /Users/donmc/msi/projects/github/donmcg/donmcg.github.io

  $ git push -u origin main
  # docs say in the future I can just use $ git push 

  $ vim ~/.gvimrc
  # comment out the line "set bg=dark" so that gui_running sets background=light
  # this makes it easier to see the colors when editing files in vim
.

{% endhighlight %}

- I prefer the donmc alias, but on github and mastadon it's donmcg.
- On m2 see .../projects/github/donmcg/...
- California is -7 hours from UTC hence "2025-09-25 01:00:00 -0700"
