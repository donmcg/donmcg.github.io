Working on the SU piston project.  I want a state diagram to help
with managing the Park position of the target.

Back in [this post]({% post_url 2025-10-26-notebook %}) I introduced
mermaid for creating diagrams such as this:


<pre class="mermaid">
    graph TD
        A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
        B --> C[Server01]
        B --> D[Server02]
</pre>

<br>

<pre class="mermaid">
    graph TD
      B[*] --> Still
      Still --> E[*]
      
      Still --> Moving
      Moving --> Still
      Moving --> Crash
      Crash --> E[*]
</pre>

<br>
---

<pre class="mermaid">
  graph TD;
      X-->Y;
      Q[ square ] --> Still;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
</pre>

<br>

This line of inquiry was abandoned when I realized, yet again, that I was
making things too complicated.  Still, this page does represent some 
incremental progress using mermaid.

Note there are different 'dialects' of mermaid and some examples I found
and tried here didn't work until being edited.  In particular,
this dialect requires node identifiers for every relation:

{%- comment -%}
{%- endcomment -%}
{% highlight bash %}
{% raw %}
      B[*] --> Still

rather than 

       [*] --> Still
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
