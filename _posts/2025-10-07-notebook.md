As I said...
More or less have the topical vs all-in-one working.
Now it's time to commit this mess and then clean up to get ready
for the 'real thing'.

commit c283181290872493fb39cd47eecae8d2889257cb (HEAD -> main)
Author: donmc
Date:   Tue Oct 7 06:50:32 2025 -0700

    cleanup prior to revamp of landing page
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Following this I updated /index.html for the Home page to highlight
most of the work I've done so far.  Although it only shows the
existing development site, it captures my main goals and is a 
good candidate to push out to the live site for verification.
