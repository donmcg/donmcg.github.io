As I said...
More or less have the topical vs all-in-one working.
Now it's time to commit this mess and then clean up to get ready
for the 'real thing'.

{% highlight git %}
{% raw %}
commit c283181290872493fb39cd47eecae8d2889257cb (HEAD -> main)
Author: donmc
Date:   Tue Oct 7 06:50:32 2025 -0700

    cleanup prior to revamp of landing page
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Following this I updated /index.html for the Home page to highlight
most of the work I've done so far.  Although it only shows the
existing development site, it captures my main goals and is a 
good candidate to push out to the live site for verification.

{% highlight git %}
{% raw %}
commit 8fd39f28f25b4c9bad89754ffb63d735bf0798a1 (HEAD -> main)
Author: donmc
Date:   Tue Oct 7 08:17:42 2025 -0700

    /index.html et.al. ready to push to github
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then 

{% highlight bash %}

  m2 $ cd /Users/donmc/msi/projects/github/donmcg/donmcg.github.io

  $ cat ../../pat

  $ git push
  # docs said I can just use $ git push 
.
{% endhighlight %}

Oops, I forgot to commit *_includes/myinclude.html*

{% highlight bash %}
  $ git add _includes/myinclude.html
  $ git commit -a -m "added myinclude.html
  $ git push
{% endhighlight %}
