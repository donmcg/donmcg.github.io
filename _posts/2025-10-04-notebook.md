Building include file for topical linking to markdown files in collections.

As of this moment the *meat.html* file provides topical links to the 
*_animal* category.

{% highlight git %}
{% raw %}

    links to pages grouped by topic in meat.html
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now the idea is to reuse those ideas as a single include file for 
each category landing page.  For this see *_includes/topical_links.html*.

As an example the  *_vegetable* category could include in *plant.html*:
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% assign veggie_pages = site.vegetable %}
{% include topical_links.html pages=veggi_pages %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For a category page to be listed under a topic it must include a *topics*
list in its front matter.  The page will be listed under all topics
to which it has been assigned:
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
topics: [scratchpad, notebook, thesis]
  ...
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Ah... but it's not so easy to pass site.vegetable as an include variable...
The trick is to use the *include.* prefix within the include file:

{% highlight liquid %}
The topical_links.html include file 
{% raw %}
{% for page in include.pages %}
...
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight liquid %}
The plant.html category file
{% raw %}
{% include topical_links.html pages=site.vegetable %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
