Revisiting MathJax and Mermaid

Back in this [post]({% post_url 2025-10-06-notebook %}) I discovered
MathJax and in this [post]({% post_url 2025-10-21-notebook %}) I also
found Mermaid.

Both of those were enabled by brute force.  The former by making
and editing a copy of minima _include/head.html  and the latter by
placing a *<head></head>* directly in the post page.

Here I just want to clean that up by creating *_include/mathjax.html*
and *_include/mermaid.html*.

This page is intended to demonstrate that this works. It has the
two includes at it's top:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% include mathjax.html %}
{% include mermaid.html %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

I did it this way so that ALL pages aren't needlessly enabling these
services.

So for MathJax:

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}. $$

And for Mermaid:

<pre class="mermaid">
    graph TD
        A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
        B --> C[Server01]
        B --> D[Server02]
</pre>

A side effect of this change,
removing the modified version of *_include/head.html*,
is that now old posts mentioned above don't work as they were
originally written.  So I went back and fixed them by adding the includes.
