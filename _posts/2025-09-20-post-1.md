Progress!

## The problem

Trying to get paginator to work.  A third post may help...

## The plan

Play with the paginator settings in _config.yml and blog.html 

## Current state

The jekyll-paginate gem appears to be installed on the system:
$ ls /Users/donmc/.gem/ruby/3.4.1/gems/jekyll-paginate-1.1.0/

It's not clear that paginate is working at all...

At present the index.html file attempts to display posts using paginator.posts
The index.html file has title 'Home' 

## Actions
Having added the inital content of this post, with paginate: 2 (3 posts total)
I see that the HOME link in the header now appears twice...
One of them shows posts 3 and 2, the other shows post 1


Setting paginate: 1, restarting the server, now there are 3 Home links
and each one shows only one post.

It's working.
