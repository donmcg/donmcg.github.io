Moving on to building the real site.

OK, let me try to summarize my thinking so far.

Each *CATEGORY* (_animal, _vegetable, _mineral) is sub-classified by *TOPIC*:

> 1. CATEGORY
>    - TOPIC
>      * BOOK

A *BOOK* is simply a link to a markdown file with *front matter*:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
title: some fool thing
topics: [alpha, beta]
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Every *BOOK* file will be listed by *title:* under every *topics:* heading.

Optionally, a *BOOK* may also include in its *front matter*...
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
book: bookname
level: book
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

...and perhaps something along the lines of

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Here are the book chapters for bookname:
<ol>
{% include book_chapter_list.html pages=site.mineral book=bookname %}
</ol>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

... which will provide a listing like ...

> 1. THEME
>    - CHAPTER TITLE X
>    - CHAPTER TITLE Y

... from files in the category with *front matter* like so...
{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
title: a chapter with a purpose
book: bookname
chapter: chaptername
level: chapter
themes: [x, y]
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

...finally these *chapter* markdowns can link to *page* markdowns
with *front matter* as...

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
title: a page from the book of life
book: life
book: bookname
chapter: chaptername
page: pagename
level: page
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

...via a link from the chapter markdown like...

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
[link to another page in this book]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _mineral/bookname.chaptername.page_a.md %})
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

# extra credit

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
title: a page from the book of life
reference:
 - level: page
 - book: bookname
 - chapter: chaptername
 - page: pagename
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

and then iterate: (the following example needs to be embellished)
note: page.reference 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% for reference in page.reference %}
  # reference[0] will be like 'bookname' for reference[1] like 'book'
  <a href="{{ link[1] }}">{{ link[0] }}</a>
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

I will want the library to start off showing something like
> 1. mini
>     - history
>     - measurement
>         * deluxe gas gauge
>         * bottom hose temperature
>         * knock sensor
>         * su needle position
>         * afr
>         * compression ratio
>         * fuel pressure
>     - equipment
>         * smoke generator
>         * can bus
>         * bipolar power supply
>     - maintenance
>         * oil
> 2. home
>     - furniture
>         * closet
>     - yard
>         * deck
>         * fence
>         * pool plumbing
>     - shop
>         * shelf
> 3. music
>     - arrangements
>       * scotch and soda
