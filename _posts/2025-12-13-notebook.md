I've added some content to the SU piston project but now want to add
some images.

Back in this [post]({% post_url 2025-10-27-notebook %}) I worked out
how to remove metadata.  Now I also want to reduce the file size of
the images....

Here's a procedure.

---

Save the image to a local file: *dirty_my_image.jpeg*


{% highlight bash %}
 # look at the file to see the metadata
m2 $ exiftool dirty_my_image.jpeg

 # make a copy
   $ cp dirty_my_image.jpeg clean_my_image.jpeg

 # remove the metadata
   $ exiftool -all= -overwrite_original clean_my_image.jpeg

 # look at the file to see the reduced metadata
   $ exiftool clean_my_image.jpeg

{% endhighlight %}


Now use Preview to crop and rotate the clean_my_image.jpeg
Warning Preview will overwrite the file!

{% highlight bash %}
 # reduce the image file size
   $ magick convert clean_my_image.jpeg -quality 10 small_my_image.jpeg

 # double check the metadata
   $ exiftool small_my_image.jpeg

{% endhighlight %}

Here I use a quality of 10% which seems to work well for smartphone images.
