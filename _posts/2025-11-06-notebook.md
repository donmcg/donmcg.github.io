# Notes for building donmc.github.io

Preparing for actual content to be added to site!

Finally!  I am ready to build some actual content!!

I'll start somewhere... like where I am in the SU position project right now..

---

{% assign there = site.url | append: "/mini/project/su.piston.position/calib.7.2/" %}

I'll start with the calibration 7.2 fixture: shown here 
[cal7.2 page]({{there}}calib.7.2-.html)


For that there are a bunch of images.
I'd like to make smaller versions that don't take so much file space.

I tried using **preview->resample** but that didn't make the file smaller.

The app store has **ImageOptim** 

Then there's **right-click->Quick Actions->Convert Image** which does allow for reducing the image size but tripled the size of the file!

Hang on.  Yet another approach: **style="width:250px;height:250px;"** as an img
option sets the displayed size without needing a different file.

Oddly style seems to be tied up with css to the point that it's hard to
get a concise list of its set of options. Here are some...

- max-width: 100%; /* Image will scale down to fit its container */
- height: auto; /* Maintains aspect ratio */

{% highlight bash %}
m2 $ bundle show minima
/Users/donmc/.gem/ruby/3.4.1/gems/minima-2.5.1
$ open -a Preview /Users/donmc/.gem/ruby/3.4.1/gems/minima-2.5.1/README.md
-> no joy
{% endhighlight %}

How to render the README.md file?  Safari:no, Preview:no...

> Quick Look Extension: The most common solution is to install a third-party Quick Look extension like QLMarkdown or Markdown Preview from the App Store. Once installed and enabled in System Settings, selecting a Markdown file in Finder and pressing the spacebar will show a rendered preview instead of plain text.

This looks a bit hokey but it appears that **QLMarkdown** is better suited
to my needs than **Markdown Preview**.  Let's try it...

{% highlight bash %}
$ brew update
...
$ brew upgrade
...
$ brew install --cask qlmarkdown
🍺  qlmarkdown was successfully installed!

{% endhighlight %}

>Now go to /donmc/Applications folder, find and right-click on **QLMarkdown.app**then go to System Settings > Security & Privacy, scroll down and find QLMarkdown notification and click "Open Anyway". 
>
>"You can manage extensions in **Login Items & Extensions**

Phew! well that does something! Now from Finder I can right click

Now I can use Finder to navigate to the README.md file and right-click
and open with QlMarkdown.app. More or less this is what I was looking for.

One of the first things in the README file is a reference to the [Minima Demo Site](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/).  

But after all of that, I haven't found a listing of the css properties
available for minima.

After digging around a bit it seems that what I am looking for is contained
(but not documented) in these files:

- /Users/donmc/.gem/ruby/3.4.1/gems/minima-2.5.1/_sass/minima/
    - _base.scss
    - _layout.scss
    - _syntax-highlighting.scss

But I have to figure out how to use this stuff...


---

Note that this very file has contained in its front matter: 

-  layout: post

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd /Users/donmc/.gem/ruby/3.4.1/gems/minima-2.5.1/_sass/minima
$ grep post *
_layout.scss:.post-list-heading {
_layout.scss:.post-list {
_layout.scss:.post-meta {
_layout.scss:.post-link {
_layout.scss:.post-header {
_layout.scss:.post-title {
_layout.scss:.post-content {
{% endhighlight %}

Back in the README there is a statement about layouts.

So it appears that **layout: post** refers to ../minima-2.5.1/_layouts/post.html

---

For what I want, it seems that I need to be able to create my own classes
for scss.  With that, I should able to style my elements with the
**{: .myclass }** syntax.

And to do that I need to
- create local *_sass* directory at root of the site
- add a custom styles file in the *_sass* directory: *_fairhillbillies.scss*
- import the custom scss file into my main stylesheet
    - create a new *assets/main.scss* file (overriding the default one which is located at /Users/donmc/.gem/ruby/3.4.1/gems/minima-2.5.1/assets/main.scss)
    - within the new *main.scss* import "minima" and also the new styles:

{% highlight scss %}

---
# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
---

@import "minima";
@import "fairhillbillies";
{% endhighlight %}

Initial contents of *_fairhillbillies.scss*:

{% highlight scss %}
    // _sass/_fairhillbillies.scss
    .my-custom-class {
      color: blue;
      font-size: $small-font-size;
    }

    .another-class {
      background-color: lightgray;
      padding: 10px;
      @include relative-font-size(1.9375);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

---

Now, in this post's markdown file I have the paragraphs

{% highlight liquid %}
This uses class my-custom-class
{: .my-custom-class }

This uses class another-class
{: .another-class }
{% endhighlight %}

Which renders as:

This uses class my-custom-class
{: .my-custom-class }

This uses class another-class
{: .another-class }

Awesome! And notice that *$small-font-size* and *relative-font-size()*
are honored. These come from minima.

RAW html styling of image with text to its right:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="max-width: 20%; max-height: 20%;" >
    <img src="{{isrc}}">
  </div>
  <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
           <h1>Mini wearing its winter wardrobe.</h1>

           Mini wearing its winter wardrobe.
  </div>
</div>
<br>

\\
Same as above but using css classes defined in **_fairhillbillies.scss**:

<div class="containerExampleK">
  <div class="figureExampleK">
    <img src="{{isrc}}">
  </div>
  <div class="textExampleK">
           <h1>Mini wearing its winter wardrobe.</h1>

           Mini wearing its winter wardrobe.
  </div>
</div>
<br>

---

\\
Similar as above but using **include figureExampleK**:

{% include figureExampleK.html
           img-dir=image-dir
           img-file='tarp_mini.jpeg'
           alt='tarp covered mini'
           caption=
           '
           <h1>Mini wearing its winter wardrobe.</h1>

           Mini wearing its winter wardrobe.
           '
%}

GitHub Pages supports a specific set of Jekyll plugins. These plugins are enabled by default and cannot be disabled. They include: 
jekyll-coffeescript
jekyll-default-layout
jekyll-gist
jekyll-github-metadata
jekyll-optional-front-matter
jekyll-paginate
jekyll-readme-index
jekyll-titles-from-headings
jekyll-relative-links
Additionally, you can enable other supported plugins by adding their respective gems to the plugins setting in your _config.yml file. The jekyll-remote-theme plugin is also available and allows you to load other themes. 
It is important to note that GitHub Pages cannot build sites using unsupported plugins. If you wish to use plugins not included in the default or supported list, you will need to generate your site locally and then push the resulting static files to GitHub.
