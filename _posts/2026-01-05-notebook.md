I am having success developing the
[Fairhillbillies SU Piston Position Sensor]({{ site.url | append: "/mini/project/su.piston.position/su.piston.position-fairhillbillies.html" }} )
and I'd like to begin sharing my work.
It appears that honoring licenses is a good idea before I post
any of the details.

So what is appropriate?

My projects are often a combination of hardware and software.  Those 
components are often leveraged from the open source work of others.
My motivation is to similarly share my work with others.  If they want
to use it in their own projects, as I have, then that's fine.  If they
should desire to develop a commercial product based on my work, that's
fine too.

The example that comes to mind is Arduino itself.  It provides open source
access to both software and hardware designs.  Perhaps I can do something 
similar?  

Arduino suggests the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.  What is that?

In the video [below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCuPbW31vAw),
is reference to this [github project](https://github.com/SensorsIot/Wi-Fi-Sniffer-as-a-Human-detector).
But there appears to be no license published there at all!


The best I can figure is to use MIT, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, or AGPLv3
for the software and CC-BY-SA-4.0 for
the hardware.  This means that I will need to publish the CAD files too.

Some examples of sites with licenses:

* This one is pretty close to my case.  There is some hardware in
addition to the Arduino. The simple
[hardware is described](https://help.argusmonitor.com/HardwareexampleArduino.html)
in some detail.  There is a schematic but no BOM or CAD files per. se.

| [arguscontroller](https://github.com/openfancontrol/arguscontroller) |
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) |

* This one is a good example. It has hardware and software and two licenses.

| [Upsy Desky](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky) | [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky?tab=License-1-ov-file) | [MIT](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky?tab=MIT-2-ov-file) |

* This one is pure software and does not really touch on hardware.

| [MarlinFirmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) |
[GPL license](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/bugfix-2.1.x/LICENSE) |

Having established the above, I have added the MIT and CC license files
directly in the repo.  Now I have to figure out how to merge with
my local branch...

Here's what I did on m2:

{% highlight bash %}
 # go to the local repo
 $ site

 # tidy up loose ends
 $ git status
 ...
 $ git commit -a -m "message"

 # get the changes from github
 $ git fetch origin

 # look at what is different
 $ git diff --name-status origin/main

 # merge local repo with changes in main
 $ git merge origin/main

 # push the local repo, with its updates, back to github
 $ git push
{% endhighlight %}
