For the moment let's set aside the question of further organization
{% comment %}
as was started [post]({% post_url 2025-10-15-notebook.md %}).
{% endcomment %}

Instead let's provide a few arrangements:

---

> Home page
> 
> 1. stuff
> 2. music
>   - arrangements
>      + scotch and soda
> 3. other stuff

{% highlight bash %}

  m2 $ cd /Users/donmc/msi/projects/github/donmcg/donmcg.github.io
  
  $ mkdir _music
  $ cp ../_animal/binder _music  # not strictly needed
  $ cp ../_animal/bird_.md _music/arrangements_.md
  $ vi  _music/arrangements_.md

    # arrangements for a folk trio
  $ vi _config.yml

    # <li>Music</li>
    # { % include binder_topics_list.html collection=site.music name="music" % }
  $ bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --baseurl="" # aka 'serve'

---> verify that all is working so far, it is

  $ vi  _music/arrangements_.md 
    # Arrangements for a folk trio:
    #
    # 1. [ScotchAndSoda]({% link assets/file/ScotchAndSoda.pdf %}) 

---> verify that all is working so far, it is

.

{% endhighlight %}

This is just a starting point.  The structure is subject to change
in the future!

From here I just need to copy new pdf files to the assets/file/ directory
and add the link in _music/arrangements_.md
