Continuing on the theme of adding chordpro pdf files

It's not arrangements, rather it's lead sheets:

>   - leadsheet
>     - lead sheets for trio
> 3. other stuff

Now I've learned that I can indeed cycle through the .pdf files 
in a way similar to */_includes/navigation.html*.

First the lead sheets can be enumerated in */_data/leadsheet.yml*.
Note that this is the only place that the file names of the
lead sheets have to be explicitly written.  Add it here and it will
appear...

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}

- name: Old Blue
  title: a song about a good dog
  link: /assets/leadsheet/OldBlue.2.pdf
- name: Scotch And Soda
  title: a song about wistful love
  link: /assets/leadsheet/ScotchAndSoda.pdf
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then in */_includes/leadsheet.html*:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<ol>
  {% for sheet in site.data.leadsheet %}
	<li>
		<a href="{{ sheet.link }}" title="{{ sheet.title }}" >
			{{ sheet.name }} </a>
	</li>
  {% endfor %}

</ol>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally the file */_music/_leadsheet_.md* (note **layout: default**!):

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}

layout: default
title: lead sheets for trio

Arrangements for a folk trio:

1. [ScotchAndSoda]({% link assets/leadsheet/ScotchAndSoda.pdf %})
1. [OldBlue]({% link assets/leadsheet/OldBlue.2.pdf %})
1. [SaltyDog]({% link assets/leadsheet/SaltyDog.1.pdf %})
1. [DogiesLament]({% link assets/leadsheet/DogiesLament.1.pdf %})
1. [Flatnose]({% link assets/leadsheet/Flatnose.1.pdf %})

{% include navigation.html %}

# Lead Sheets

{% include leadsheet.html %}

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


This is just a starting point.  The structure is subject to change
in the immediate future!

From here I just need to copy new pdf files to the *assets/file/* directory
and add the link in *_data/leadsheet.yml*. 

Note: That fat **{% comment %} ... {% endcomment %}** in the middle 
of *leadsheet_.md*, while apparently syntactically correct, causes 
a weird server warning:

{% highlight text %}
Warning: Excerpt modified in _music/leadsheet_.md!
         Found a Liquid block containing the excerpt separator "\n\n". 
         The block has been modified with the appropriate closing tag.
         Feel free to define a custom excerpt or excerpt_separator in the document's front matter if the generated excerpt is unsatisfactory.
{% endhighlight %}

Deleting the comment fixes the warning.
