I need to use a new ATmega328P chip.  It needs a bootloader.
Here's how I did that using Apple Silicon M2 laptop...

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Open new sketch
3. Connect Pocket AVR to USB port (on right)
4. Blue and Red lights! Allow to connect.
5. IDE: Tools > Programmer > USBtinyISP
6. Set switch to "Power Target" on AVR Pocket Programmer 
7. Install blank (no bootloader, as provided by DigiKey) ATmega328P-PU DIP in 
   socket on UNO-R3 board. Pin 1 is next to the ICSP header.
8. Connect ribbon cable from Pocket AVR to UNO-R3 ICSP header. Orient Pin 1!
9. Note that LEDs immediately illuminate on the UNO-R3 board.
10. IDE: Tools > Burn Bootloader
   Burning Bootloader
	 Done Burning Bootloader
11. Disconnect USB to Pocket AVR Programmer
12. Disconnect cable between Pocket AVR and UNO-R3
13. IDE: File > Examples > Basic > Blink
14. Connect USB to UNO-R3
15. Compile Blink sketch
16. Compile and Upload Blink sketch
  Sketch uses 924 bytes (2%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
  Global variables use 9 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving 2039 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
17. Observe blinking LED.
18. Success!
