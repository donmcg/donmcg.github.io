# This file lists the navigation links
# Note that it refers to files in the _site directory that is filled by jekyll
# That operation renders .md files as .html
# So be careful to avoid source files myfile.md and myfile.html in same dir!
# Also tricky here:  link to a directory /dir/ implies /dir/index.html
