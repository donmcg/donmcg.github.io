## Basic Transportation

In the mid '70s, fresh out of high school, I joined the 'self-supporting'
lifestyle and moved into a basement apartment.  Up until then my only
form of personal transportation was a bicycle, which by then had been
upgraded to the Crescent Världsmästarcykeln, my principle bicycle for 
the next 40 years.  However the requirements of gainful employment
required my daily travel distance to exceed the reasonable range of
a bicycle.  Coming to my rescue, a friends' motorcycle mechanic boyfriend
set me up with an old Suzuki 250 which was presented to me as parts in a box.

Reassembling the '250 soon proved to exceed my skills as a bicycle mechanic
so I was forced to implore my mechanic friend to do it for me.  Which was
agreeable provided I compensate him with actual money.  Which I did...
first lesson learned...  The reassembled machine was marvelous and provided
the needed transportation to my job where I repaired so called 'consumer stereo
equipment'. But not all was right with it.  From time to time, on the freeway,
the engine would seize for a moment (scary) and it had a tendency to blow
head gaskets (which I learned to replace myself.)
All too soon the Suzuki ceased responding to such ministration and
my mechanic friend offered another solution: a Honda 90.

The Honda proved to be a dependable vehicle despite the fact that its
generator no longer operated and necessitated regular visits to my
battery charger. By now I had moved into a house with roommates and also
acquired a girlfriend.  Her brother had a friend who desperately needed
some form of functional transportation -- and had an immobile car to trade
for it.  So my girlfriend and I went to see the car.

## Clown Car

I had never seen such a car!  It was tiny!  And it was painted in multiple
different colors with flower decals applied all over it.
A true child of the '60s.
It reminded me of a center ring circus act I had once seen where an
unbelievable number of clowns emerged from a similar sized vehicle
(maybe it was a mini?)  I had to have it and it became *the clown car*.

But of course, it did not run.  So we borrowed a car and tied the mini to
it with a tow rope and set out for the journey to my house.  I sat in 
the mini to steer while being pulled but at the first stop sign discovered
that there were no brakes and crashed into the tow car and ruined the
grill.  Then I figured out that I could still use the hand brake to stop --
a lesson that I was to forget.

Driveway triage revealed the engine would not run. Attended to the usual
points and plugs but soon found no compression in one cylinder which
suggested a burnt valve.  I was accustomed to removing heads based on my
Suzuki experience.  At the machine shop the burnt valve was confirmed and
suggested that a 'magnaflux' inspection should be performed.  It
revealed a crack so the head was scrapped and substituted with
another used head from the breaker yard.  This head was not cracked and
the valve job was completed.

With the reworked head in place the engine finally started!  But in the
process the rotten exhaust pipe had fallen away from the manifold.
The surprisingly loud noise of an open exhaust manifold has an interesting
somewhat musical chirp quality as each cylinder's resonant frequency increases
during the exhaust stroke.  Somewhat like a 100 pound canary. With some clever
application of manifold sealer the exhaust pipe was refitted and the
car was ready for the road.

My commute was perhaps 10 miles across town and I knew I had to be careful
owing to the lack of a functioning brake pedal.  Fortunately most of
the journey was a single straight road and by regulating my speed, and with
the occasional use of the hand brake I was able to negotiate the stop lights.
And soon there it was...  The building of my employer!  I had made it!

I was so excited that I drove into the parking lot and aimed for a
parking place that was backed up by the building.  But in that moment
of elation I forgot that I had no brakes.  Crash! Into the side of the building.
"I'm here!!!" Oh well, at least the front end was already smashed so this
didn't make it much worse.  My reputation was made.

... more to come ...
