# Bespoke Engine

As a classic mini enthusiast pursuing the hobby in the latter 20th
century and beyond
it is inevitable that at some point a rebuilt A-series engine
will be required.  My personal naivety in regard to such activities
may prove useful, entertaining and laughable.  This chapter attempts to
capture some of my personal recollections, revelations and lessons learned
along this path.

The list of 
[some vehicles I have owned]({{ site.url | append: "/mini/history/history_.html" }})
forms the backdrop for this article.  The large majority of vehicles on the
list featured some form of A-series engine.  Most of them required
significant engine work at one point or the other.
The following focuses on cars with significant enough engine work to
become, in some sense, bespoke.
This is to say they were no longer configured according to factory
specifications.
And it's safe to say that, due to age
or the rebuild processes involved, none of these engines ever met
ideal expectations!  I seldom realized that my challenges
stemmed from the mismatching of various components used.

Such work was generally a learning experience for me.  I usually did not know
what I didn't know and approached these projects with hubris.
It was not until relatively
late in the timeline that the internet became available with its
amazing benefit of information.  And even with that, I am still able
to stumble ahead with my usual state of unwitting ignorance.

## A brief review of my various engine configurations

- ### "Red"

  A classic early mini 850 engine.
  
  Original head was cracked and unsalvageable.  Replacement head required
  valve replacement and skimming. Engine burned oil.
  
  Attempted 'rebuild' of engine: reground crank, honed cylinders, new rings.  
  Reused many old parts.  Resulting engine ran poorly and leaked oil.
  
  Acquired MG 1100 engine from breaker yard for rebuilding but found that
  it had thrown a piston and was worthless.

- ### 67 Cooper

  A 1275 engine with dual HS4 carbs and a nitrided crankshaft.

- ### MG Midget

  A 1275 engine with dual HS4 carbs.

- ### exponent/INIW

  A 1275 Austin America engine with single HIF44 carb and smog head. 
  
  The AA engine setup was a bit cantankerous but somewhat reliable. 
  The whole drive train package was transferred from *exponent*
  and placed into the *INIW* body where it served until it failed
  and was garaged for a period.

- ### Heritage

  A brand new Heritage MK-IV body shell was obtained and served as
  the carriage for a commissioned project.
  
  The AA engine was extracted from *INIW* and supplied as the core for 
  "Professional" rebuild that included a salvaged and
  rebuilt HIF44 carb, an 11-stud head, and the usual laundry list
  of ancillary items.
  
  Also added a Jack Knight 5-speed transmission for freeway motoring.
  
  All of the above along with new/salvage running gear and other fitments
  were included in the commission.  The target spec was along the lines
  of a Morris Cooper.

  This commission was completed and ran "fairly well" for several years.

## The A-plus

This is where the bespoke story really begins.

I found myself with spare time c.a. 2015 and decided it was time for
me to substantially update my *Heritage* car.  This was to involve
near complete disassembly and refurbishment or replacement for the
entire vehicle.  This time I would do most of the work instead of
contracting it.  Since, after all, this is a vintage vehicle some aspects
of this effort continue to the present day.

A significant goal was to replace the AA engine with a fully restored
A-plus package.  The engine build was commissioned with a well known specialist
as I knew that I did not have the proper resources for the job.
After review it was decided to retain and rebuild the 11-stud head and to
rebuild the HIF44. The 5-speed transmission was declared a total loss.
The remainder of the AA donor was scrapped while
a used A-plus block and rod-change transmission were secured as the basis
for the new build.

Needless to say I had many questions regarding choices of cam shaft,
distributor, valve train etc.  The notion of making the engine
compatible with a turbo was discussed and dismissed. 
I settled on simply producing a normally aspirated engine that was suitable
for operation with available fuels.  To that end I asked about the compression
ratio but was told "not to worry."  The engine would be bored and decked,
the crankshaft turned and the head rebuilt and skimmed.
Upon completion, the assembled engine was mounted in a test stand and
was shown to run.



  then...

  New HIF44 added.

  Rebuilt A+ head added.
